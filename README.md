# PySignment
A repository founded during the UZH software construction module where tests and additional tasks were added to an assembler and virtual machine.

## Pattern
**Issue:** "CATEGORY-TYPE: Issue Summary" <br>
**Branch:** "category-type-branchname" <br>
**Commit:** "CATEGORY-TYPE: Commit message" <br>

**Categories:** "DOCUMENTATION", "UNITTESTING", "ASSEMBLER", "DISASSEMBLER", "DEBUGGER", "EXAMPLE" <br>
**Types:** "FEATURE", "BUGFIX" <br>

**Issue summary:** Standard english sentence casing. <br>
**Branch name:** All lower case. <br>
**Commit message:** message: All lower case with first letter uppercase. <br>

## Workflow
1. Assign issues to members.
2. Members create branches and commit changes.
3. Members open pull requests which the others review.
4. When merged, issue gets closed.

## Structure
**Repository level:** Repository, administrative and dev related things. <br>
**Distribution level:** UZH module assignment. <br>
